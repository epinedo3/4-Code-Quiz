# 4-Code-Quiz
## Description

The purpose of this Challenge-4 was to create a timed quiz with a Javascript theme. There is a public Javascript quiz in w3Schools; and I was able to grab sample questions for my quiz from there. Moving on, my quiz is scored by time rather than by a grade due to the nature of the website. The graphics of this quiz is very plain at best, but the main focus was for the site to be operational. Thanks to this challenge I was able to get a better understanding of Arrays, buttons, and how to get/call elements, classes, and id's.
